# 🌦️ Weather Analytics Dashboard  

A real-time **Weather Analytics Dashboard** built with **Power BI**, integrating live data from a **Weather API** and designed with the help of **Figma** to achieve a clean, modern, and intuitive user interface.  

This project combines **data storytelling** with **visual design**, offering an insightful look into current weather conditions, air quality, and forecasts — all in one interactive dashboard.

---

## 📊 Project Overview  

The goal of this project was to create a dashboard that not only delivers real-time insights but also feels visually engaging and easy to navigate.  

Using **Power BI**, I connected data from a **Weather API** that provides dynamic, up-to-date information on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.  
Meanwhile, **Figma** helped me design the layout, choose the color palette, and plan the user experience before bringing everything to life in Power BI.

## ⚙️ Key Features  

- 🌡️ **Live Weather Data:** Displays real-time temperature, humidity, and wind speed.  
- 💨 **Air Quality Index (AQI):** Visualizes pollutant levels and AQI categories.  
- 🌅 **Sunrise & Sunset Tracking:** Highlights daily solar cycle insights.  
- ☔ **7-Day Forecast:** Offers weather predictions with rain probability.  
- 🎨 **Figma-Inspired Design:** Custom layout, icons, and themes for a modern look.  
- 📈 **Data Storytelling:** Smooth transitions, interactive visuals, and tooltips to enhance interpretation.

## 🧩 Workflow  

1. **API Integration:**  
   Connected Power BI to a real-time weather API to fetch updated data periodically.  

2. **Data Modeling:**  
   Structured the API data and created relationships for key metrics like temperature, AQI, and forecast details.  

3. **DAX Measures:**  
   Created DAX measures to calculate average weather stats, AQI classification, and conditional formatting for indicators.  

4. **Dashboard Design:**  
   Designed the overall look and feel in **Figma**, defining layout, color themes, and typography before implementing in Power BI.  

5. **Deployment & Testing:**  
   Validated the data refresh functionality and optimized visuals for clarity and performance.
